An introduction to statistical learning_with applications in R_exercises
This repository contains solutions to exercises from the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

## About the Book

*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R* (ISLR) is a comprehensive guide to the fundamental concepts of statistical learning.
The book covers a wide range of topics including linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, and clustering.
It is widely used in both academic settings and by practitioners in the field of data science.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter having its own directory containing the exercises for that chapter.
Each exercise is accompanied by a detailed solution implemented in R. The structure is as follows:
```sh
ISLR-Exercises/
├── Chapter1/
│ ├── Exercise1.R
│ └── Exercise2.R
├── Chapter2/
│ ├── Exercise1.R
│ └── Exercise2.R
│ ...
└── Chapter10/
├── Exercise1.R
